# chumpy3
Fork of Chumpy version 0.67.6 by Matthew Loper. Updated to (possibly) work with Python3. 

All I did was go to [this URL](https://pypi.org/project/chumpy/#files) and download the files. I edited all the `print` statements and `import` statements to be compatible with Python3. There is absolutely no guarantee that it runs as expected, but it no longer throws errors for my use case.

To get it to work:
* `git clone https://github.com/jbohnslav/chumpy3.git`
* `pip install -e chumpy3`
